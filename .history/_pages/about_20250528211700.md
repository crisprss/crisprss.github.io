Hello, I'm Fengyu Liu, a Ph.D. student in the System and Software Security Laboratory at Fudan University, advised by Prof. [Yuan Zhang](https://yuanxzhang.github.io/) and Prof. [Min Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UnKf9FIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am also the captain of Whitzard, a great CTF team at Fudan University.

My research interests includes **web security** and **LLM-based agent security**. To date, I have published 7 papers at top-tier international security conferences, including IEEE S&P, ACM CCS, and USENIX Security, with one receiving the Distinguished Paper Award at S&P'25. Moreover, my research has been adopted by leading companies such as **Alibaba, ByteDance, and Huawei**, and acknowledged in security advisories by major tech companies including Apple, Microsoft, and Intel.
